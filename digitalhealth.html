            <p>In recent memory, no other event has tested the healthcare sector like the COVID-19 pandemic, and like
                any
                other test, it is leaving many questions in its wake - changing stakeholders’ perspectives on several
                key
                aspects and functions, particularly within the digital transformation framework. According to an
                Accenture
                survey, 93 per cent of healthcare providers reported that they are innovating with a sense of urgency,
                this
                year.

                What is the implication of such widespread technology adoption? It will impact the way hospitals deliver
                in-patient, out-patient, telemedicine, ambulance, and other core services. But it will also escalate
                costs-per-patient, requiring the management to develop new business models aimed at optimising care
                delivery
                and resources. Any new model must factor in new regulations, like the UAE’s healthcare data protection
                law
                that restricts how patients’ data is shared. Under this scenario, digital transformation will
                necessitate
                meticulous planning, expert advice, and methodical implementation. So, what do these entail?</p>
            <h3>Horizontal approach: Enhancing core competencies</h3>
            <p>As customer experience came to the forefront, in services across business and industry, it made a
                delayed-yet-determined entry into the healthcare sector. The corporatisation of healthcare also played
                into this development. Today, patient experience is the cornerstone of the sector, as it gears up for
                increased digitalisation across its value chain. In terms of the horizontal approach, the sector is
                witnessing large investments in remote clinical capabilities - including telemedicine and virtual
                consultations.</p>

            <p>Patients can now access app-based on their smartphones; and the rise of immersive technologies is adding
                value to virtual consultations. Some of the more accessible scenarios enabled by digitalisation include:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>App based updates and communications that allow in-patients and their families to stay abreast of
                    updates, and communicate with doctors, nursing staff, and hospital administration seamlessly.</li>
                <li>Patients can keep detailed and automatically updated medical records for themselves, making their
                    medical history easily accessible.</li>
                <li>Patients and their caregivers can set reminders and automate notifications; including for surgery
                    dates, recommended routines, managing pregnancies and child birth; and vaccination schedules.</li>
                <li>Patients can use a centralised data depository to register emergency contacts and potential donors
                    for themselves, in case of emergencies.</li>
            </ul>
